# Machine learning strategies for multi-step-ahead time series forecasting

The code implements some of the forecasting strategies that I have developped in my [PhD thesis](http://theses.ulb.ac.be/ETD-db/collection/available/ULBetd-10072014-002434/unrestricted/thesis_bentaieb_final.pdf).

I am planning to make an R package of my code soon.
